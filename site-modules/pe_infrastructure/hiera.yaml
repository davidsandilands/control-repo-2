hierarchy:
  - name: "Module Data"
  # The pe_infrastructure::data() function relies on PuppetX::Puppetlabs::Meep::Config
  # to lookup enterprise hiera data, and the Config class has its own path set.
  # This might change in the future, but for right now, no path is set in the
  # module hierarchy layer.  If a path was set here, and it was absent, hiera would
  # fail to load the pe_infrastructure::data() hash function altogether.
